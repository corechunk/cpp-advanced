# C++ Multi-File Build System

This repository, "cpp-advanced," provides a lightweight build system for multi-file C++ projects, using `build.bat` (Windows) and `build.sh` (Linux/macOS) to automate compilation and execution without relying on complex tools like CMake. Configurable via `srp/build.txt`, it supports `clang++` by default (extendable to `g++` or others) and compiles `.cpp` files from `src` and `lib` into a single executable (`app` or `app.exe`). The included C++ codebase serves as a generic example, making the project ideal for non-beginners who want a simple, customizable build process.

## Features
- **Simple Build Scripts**: Automate compilation with `build.bat` (Windows) and `build.sh` (Linux/macOS).
- **Highly Configurable**: Customize build settings via `srp/build.txt` (e.g., C++ standard, compiler paths, debug options).
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS with `clang++` (configurable for `g++` or others).
- **No Build Tool Dependency**: Eliminates the need for CMake or similar tools.
- **Generic Example**: Includes a sample multi-file C++ codebase in `src` and `lib` for testing.

## Why This Build System?
Compiling multi-file C++ projects often requires complex tools like CMake, which can be daunting for non-beginners. This project offers:
- **Simplicity**: Automates compilation with minimal setup using batch and bash scripts.
- **Flexibility**: Extensive configuration options for compiler, paths, and build behavior.
- **Transparency**: Clear, editable scripts and configuration file for easy customization.
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates scripting for build automation, ideal for learning.

## Requirements
To use this build system, you need:
- A **C++ compiler** must be installed and available in your PATH:
  - For C++ Compilers: [Visit This Link](https://github.com/corechunk/extras/blob/main/filescompilers/c_cpp_compilers.md)
- Git to clone the repository.
- A terminal or command prompt to run the build scripts.

## How the Build System Works
The build system automates compilation of multi-file C++ projects using build.bat (Windows) and build.sh (Linux/macOS):

* ### Process:
1. Clears previous build artifacts (.o, .exe, .s) in the compile path (e.g., binW or binL).
2. Creates the compile path if missing.
3. Collects .cpp files from src and lib.
4. Compiles based on createObjects:
  * If enabled, compiles to .o files and links to app.exe or app (if halt="disable").
  * If disabled, compiles directly to the executable.
5. Supports special modes (e.g., preprocessing with -E, assembly with -S) via extra_flags.
6. Runs the executable with provided arguments if compilation succeeds.

* ## Configuration:
  * Controlled by srp/build.txt, which defines settings like C++ standard, compiler paths, and debug options.
* ## Advantages:
  * Automates multi-file compilation with minimal setup.
  * Highly configurable for various build scenarios.
  * Transparent scripts and configuration for easy modification.

## Build Configuration (srp/build.txt)
The `srp/build.txt` file allows extensive customization with the following settings:

| Key                     | Default Value          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| version                 | 17                     | C++ standard (e.g., 17 for C++17, 20 for C++20).                            |
| compilePathWindows      | binW                   | Windows directory for build artifacts (e.g., .o, app.exe).                  |
| compilePathLinux        | binL                   | Linux/macOS directory for build artifacts (e.g., .o, app).                  |
| exactPaths              | enable                 | If enabled, uses exact paths for compilation; else, relative paths.         |
| createObjects           | enable                 | If enabled, compiles to object files (.o) before linking.                   |
| target_triple           | x86_64-w64-mingw32     | Target architecture for cross-compilation (e.g., for MinGW on Windows).     |
| echoCompileCommands     | enable                 | If enabled, prints compilation commands for debugging.                      |
| include_paths           | (empty)                | Additional include directories (comma-separated).                           |
| library_paths           | (empty)                | Additional library directories (comma-separated).                           |
| libraries               | (empty)                | Libraries to link against (comma-separated, e.g., pthread).                 |
| extra_flags             | (empty)                | Additional compiler flags (e.g., -E for preprocessing, -S for assembly).    |
| halt                    | disable                | If enabled, halts after compiling to .o files without linking.              |
| echoDebug               | enable                 | If enabled, prints debug information during build.                          |
| echoVars                | enable                 | If enabled, prints variable values from build.txt.                          |
| echoFiles               | enable                 | If enabled, prints collected source file names.                             |
| echoIncludePaths        | enable                 | If enabled, prints include paths used.                                      |
| echoLibraryPaths        | enable                 | If enabled, prints library paths used.                                      |
| echoLibraries           | enable                 | If enabled, prints libraries linked.                                        |
| echoExtraFlags          | enable                 | If enabled, prints extra compiler flags used.                               |
| echoTargetTriple        | enable                 | If enabled, prints target triple used.                                      |

## Usage
### 1. Running the Example:
* After building, navigate to the compile path (e.g., binW or binL) and run:
cmd

```cmd
## By the way, arg/arguments are optional
app.exe [arg1 arg2 ...]  # Windows
./app [arg1 arg2 ...]    # Linux/macOS

# Instead you could pass arguments to the scripts as scripts handle them internally:
build.bat [arg1 arg2 ...]  # Windows
build.sh [arg1 arg2 ...]  # Linux/MacOS
```
* The output depends on the C++ codebase in src and lib.
### 2. Using with Your Own Code:
* Replace src and lib with your own .cpp files and include with .h files.
* Update srp/build.txt for custom settings (e.g., include_paths, libraries).
* Run build.bat or build.sh to compile.
### 3. Passing Arguments:
* You can run the build.bat/build.sh directly to pass arguments, as scripts handle them internally.

## Extending the Project
To adapt the build system for a different C++ codebase:

1. Clear or replace include, src, and lib with your own files.
2. Ensure a main.cpp (or equivalent entry point) exists in src.
3. Update srp/build.txt for specific needs (e.g., library_paths, extra_flags).
4. Modify build.bat or build.sh to:
   * Use a different compiler (e.g., replace clang++ with g++).
   * Add flags (e.g., -std=c++20, -O2).
   * Change the output executable name (e.g., from app to myapp).
5. Run the build script to compile and test your code.
## Troubleshooting
* Compilation Errors:
  * Check console output for issues (e.g., missing headers, undefined symbols).
  * Verify clang++ (or specified compiler) is in your PATH.
  * Ensure srp/build.txt settings are valid (e.g., correct paths, supported version).
* Script Issues:
  * Inspect build.bat or build.sh for path or flag errors.
  * Enable debug options in build.txt (e.g., echoCompileCommands, echoDebug) to diagnose.
* Missing Dependencies:
  * If using libraries, update libraries and library_paths in build.txt.
* Unfinished Project:
  * The project is incomplete, so test thoroughly and adapt as needed.
